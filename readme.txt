== Description ==

Globedia.com is an online "Newspaper" built by hispavista.com and both managed and edited by the community itself.

Users can publish their own news or comments directly in Globedia.com ("redactors" role) or they also can publish automatically from their blog with several connectors ("collaborators" role). 

In Globedia.com you can automate news publishing from "full rss feeds". But, if your feed is a summary feed and you don't want to change your feed configuration to a full one, this plugin is for you.

This plugin will create a hidden and non-public extra feed, only visible for Globedia.com, so you can maintain your original feeds own configuration unaltered.

After you install this plugin in your blog, please contact the globedia crew at globedia@hispavista.com and ask for your own verification code.

Available languages: Actually Globedia.com is only available for Spanish-speaking countries.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can I disable the plugin? =
>From the plugins panel you can disable it when you want. But be careful, a disabled feed will stop publishing on Globedia.com.

= Can I use this plugin although I have a full feed? =
Of course, and doing that will let you change your original feed configuration anytime without affecting your Globedia.com publishing.
